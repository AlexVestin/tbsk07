1.1
    1. in the center
    2. up, right
    3. yes using uniforms or attributes
1.2
    1. they are keywords signifying that the data is to be passed around (in/out from the shader & main program)
    2. The vertex shader handles transformations of individual vertices
    3. glUniformMatrix4fv pushes four float values to the uniform location
1.3 
    1. 50fps 0.02 sec "frame length"
1.4
    1. Needed to add an out from the vertex shader to the fragment shader.
    2. Passing information from the vertex shader to the fragment shader.
    3. ?, a uniform vec3 could be used instead
