    How can you get all four blades to rotate with just one time-dependent rotation matrix?
    - using an attribute offset and doing transformations in the shader or using different shaders
    How do you make the wings follow the body's movements?
    - multiply it by the bodys model matrix
2.
    What kind of control did you implement?
    - wasd movemebt
    Can you make this kind of control in some other way than manipulating a "look-at" matrix?
    - could move the models instead
